## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **GitHub Projects playbook** - `docs/process/GITHUB-PROJECTS.md` and `scripts/gh-project-roadmap.sh` for org Project setup, linking `8gent-code`, and bulk-adding epic **#1076** and **#1077–#1093**. Org project [**8gent-code roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/8gi-foundation/projects/1) (number `1`) is live and linked to the repo.

### Changed
- **Repository scope** - Ecosystem governance markdown (`docs/8GI-*.md`, `8GO-SPEC.md`, presentation scripts) and product PRD drafts moved to [`8gi-governance`](https://github.com/8gi-foundation/8gi-governance) and [`8gent-world`](https://github.com/8gi-foundation/8gent-world). Static `media/` decks and avatars now live under `8gent-world` (`public/media/`). This repo keeps kernel and agent documentation only.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Double shebang bug** - Build output had `#!/usr/bin/env bun` prepended twice, breaking execution on Linux. Now checks if shebang exists before prepending. This fix is critical for all Linux users and Docker-based benchmarks.
- **Cross-platform build script** - Replaced macOS-only `sed -i ''` with cross-platform Node one-liner.
- **CI workflows** - Added version sync check, secrets scan, policy engine integrity test to CI. Release workflow now auto-publishes to npm.
- **Harbor adapter** - Fixed AgentContext API (pydantic data model, not message store). Added robust Bun + 8gent installation in Docker containers.

### Added
- **Terminal-Bench Harbor adapter** (`benchmarks/harbor_adapter/`) - Runs 8gent through Terminal-Bench 2.0 via Harbor framework. Oracle baseline validated at 80%.
- **Ollama timeout increase** - 5 minute timeout for 14B model pulls.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Computer Use - Power #10** (`packages/computer/`) - Desktop automation via usecomputer bridge. Screenshot, click, type, press, scroll, drag, hover, clipboard, window list. Security-gated with point validation, max limits, dangerous key detection.
- **Process Manager** (`packages/computer/process-manager.ts`) - Process listing with memory/CPU, graceful/force quit, safe list, system-critical protection (22 blocked processes), suggest quittable apps.
- **13 desktop tools** in ToolExecutor - `desktop_screenshot`, `desktop_click`, `desktop_type`, `desktop_press`, `desktop_scroll`, `desktop_drag`, `desktop_hover`, `desktop_windows`, `desktop_clipboard`, `desktop_processes`, `desktop_quit_app`, `desktop_suggest_quit`, `desktop_safe_list`.
- **Running Apps menu** in Lil Eight's macOS menu bar - memory stats, per-app quit/force-quit dialogs, Quit All Non-Essential, protected app list.
- **CLUI tray upgrade** (`apps/clui/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) - Daemon status, session count, Resource Manager submenu, Settings submenu with daemon control, log viewer, config access.
- **AGENTS.md** - Universal agent instructions for any AI coding harness (Pi, Hermes, OpenCode, Aider, Goose, Cline, Continue, SWE-Agent).
- **NemoClaw desktop policies** - Desktop automation policy rules: read-only ops allowed, mutations require approval, dangerous key combos (cmd+q, alt+f4) hard-blocked.

### Changed
- **README.md** - Added usecomputer and Quitty to inspirations. Fixed Hermes credit to NousResearch (was incorrectly ArcadeAI).

### Removed
- **60+ quarantined tool files** - Cleaned up unused utility packages and their quarantine docs. All recoverable from git history.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Daemon Protocol** (`docs/DAEMON-PROTOCOL.md`) - WebSocket protocol specification for external clients (8gent.app, 8gent OS, Telegram). Defines connection handshake, auth, session lifecycle, prompt/response streaming, cron management, and health checks. The contract between the brain and the interfaces.
- **BRAND.md** - Canonical brand reference copied from 8gent-world. Typography (Fraunces/Inter/JetBrains Mono), color palette, domain table.
- **Changesets** - Added @changesets/cli for monorepo version management across 40+ packages.
- **Daemon gateway expansion** (`packages/daemon/gateway.ts`) - New WebSocket message types: `sessions:list`, `cron:list`, `cron:add`, `cron:remove`, `health`. External clients can now manage cron jobs and query daemon state.
- **Session state persistence** (`packages/daemon/index.ts`) - Saves active session metadata to `~/.8gent/daemon-state.json` on graceful shutdown. Clients can resume sessions after daemon restart.
- **Idle session cleanup** (`packages/daemon/agent-pool.ts`) - Sessions idle for 30+ minutes are automatically evicted. Cleanup runs every 5 minutes.

### Fixed
- **Daemon log overwrite bug** (`packages/daemon/index.ts`) - `Bun.write()` was overwriting the log file on every event instead of appending. Switched to `appendFileSync()`.
- **Ecosystem references** - CLAUDE.md and README.md now reference 8gent.dev as canonical domain and link to all ecosystem products (8gentos.com, 8gent.app, 8gentjr.com, 8gent.world, 8gent.games).

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** - Added ecosystem table and reference to BRAND.md. 8gent Code positioned as "the brain" and free on-ramp to 8gent OS.

- **Security** (`packages/validation/security-scanner.ts`, `secret-patterns.ts`) - Static security scanner: detects leaked secrets (API keys, AWS credentials, DB connection strings, JWTs, private keys) and vulnerability patterns (eval injection, SQL concat, innerHTML XSS). `scanFile`, `scanContent`, `scanDirectory` API. Pre-commit gate via `hasCriticalFindings`. Credit: [0din-ai/ai-scanner](https://github.com/0din-ai/ai-scanner) for pattern taxonomy.
- **Ability Scorecards** (`packages/validation/ability-scorecard.ts`) - Measurable metrics per ability: memory recall accuracy, worktree parallelization efficiency, policy violation rate, evolution improvement delta, healing recovery rate, entrepreneurship hit rate, AST blast radius accuracy, browser research relevance. JSONL persistence per session, baseline comparison.
- **Meta-Optimizer** (`benchmarks/autoresearch/meta-optimizer.ts`) - Optimizes beyond system prompt: mutates few-shot examples, model routing priority, grading weights (exec/keyword split), and temperature sweep. Heuristic suggestions based on what worked per category. Inspired by Karpathy's program.md meta-optimization concept.
- **Macro Action Decomposer** (`packages/orchestration/macro-actions.ts`) - Coarse-grained task delegation: topological sort on dependencies, parallel group detection, critical path analysis, speedup estimation. Kahn's algorithm for wave-based parallelization.
- **Actuator Tools** (`packages/tools/actuators/`) - Write actuators for the physical/digital world: deploy (Vercel, Railway, Fly.io), publish (npm, git tag, GitHub release), notify (Telegram, GitHub issues). Dry-run by default. All actions return undo commands where reversible.
- **Token Throughput Tracker** (`packages/orchestration/throughput-tracker.ts`) - Global tokens/sec metric across all parallel agents. Sliding window snapshots, daily reports, per-agent utilization, model and category breakdowns. JSONL persistence with 7-day retention.
- **Curriculum Skills** (`packages/eight/curriculum.ts`) - Teachable curricula with step progression, exercises, and comprehension checks. Built-in: "8gent-architecture" (5 steps) and "writing-benchmarks" (4 steps). `CurriculumRunner` generates teaching prompts.
- **Persona Mutation** (`packages/self-autonomy/persona-mutation.ts`) - Auto-tune SOUL.md calibration table from accumulated user feedback. Parses current persona parameters, records up/down feedback with evidence, suggests mutations (each feedback = +/-5, clamped 0-100). Never writes to SOUL.md directly (safety constraint).
- **Telegram Unified Portal** (`packages/telegram-bot/unified-portal.ts`) - Single portal to all automation: `/status`, `/agents`, `/benchmark`, `/deploy`, `/throughput`, `/scorecard`, `/soul`, `/help`. Auth gating, inline keyboards, auto-split for long messages. Stub handlers document integration points.

### Fixed
- **Installer color violations** — replaced forbidden `color="gray"` and `color="white"` with `dimColor` and default text in `apps/installer/src/index.tsx`
- **write_file path bug** — models sometimes pass absolute-looking paths like `/8gent-code/server.ts` that resolve outside the working directory; these are now auto-stripped to relative paths instead of throwing a path-traversal error; tool description and system prompt updated to instruct models to use relative paths

### Added
- **Dynamic free model router** — `getBestFreeModel()` in `packages/providers/index.ts` queries OpenRouter's `/api/v1/models` endpoint to find the best available free model (filtered by `:free` suffix, sorted by context length); results cached for 1 hour; `spawn_agent` now accepts `model: "auto:free"` to automatically pick the best free model
- **Evidence collection visible in TUI** — real-time evidence badges (pass/fail) appear in the chat stream after write_file, edit_file, run_command, and git_commit; one-line summary shown at end of each response; `/evidence` command shows full session breakdown with per-type counts
- **Three-layer model architecture** — base model (qwen3) + Eight LoRA (centralized training from benchmarks) + Personal LoRA (user's local fine-tune on their patterns); personal module retrains when a new Eight version releases
- **Eight model version manager** (`version-manager.ts`) — manages model promotion lifecycle with naming convention `eight-{major.minor.patch}-q{gen}:{params}`, Gemini Flash judge validates checkpoints before promotion

- **Auto-open files on macOS** — files referenced in agent output are opened automatically in the default editor
- **TUI accepts any model name** — `/model` command now accepts arbitrary model identifiers, not just predefined options

### Fixed
